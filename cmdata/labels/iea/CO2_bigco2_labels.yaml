    level:
      # Level 99 denotes memos, not to be summed up with anything
      # Note that in the IEA documentation, TFC and ELECHEAT are defined as
      # memos. However, in practice they are in fact (as far as I understand
      # the documentation, and have verfied through a quick check) equal to the
      # sum of all final consumption emissions (excl. electricity/heat and
      # energy industry own use), and sum of MAINPROD+AUTOPROD, resepectively.
      # Also, TFC+ELECHEAT+OTHEN appears to sum up to CO2FCOMB. So logically,
      # TFC and ELECHEAT should be main flows at the level directly below
      # CO2FCOMB (along with OTHEN), while the final consumption flows and
      # electricity/heat generation flows should be at the level below them
      # and have them as parents. Hence, TFC, ELECHEAT and OTHEN are at level
      # 2 below, and not 99.
