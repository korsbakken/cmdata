"""Subpackage for loading data.

At the moment this subpackage is not consistent with the rest of the cmdata
package. The initial files were copied from the `climate_trace_comparison`, and
use .ini/.cfg-based config file format read by `ConfigParser`-based classes,
rather than the yaml-based formats and codes employed by `cmdata.datadesc`.
